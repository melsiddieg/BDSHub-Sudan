# BDSHub-Sudan
**Building a Sudanese Biomedical Data Science Community Hub based on Open Science Principles!**

---

## **Welcome to the Biomedical Data Science Hub of Sudan Repository!**
This hub is an open initiative that supports the advancement of biomedical data science research and innovation in Sudan, with a focus on health equity and collaborative research. We are committed to open science principles, providing tools, data, and resources to researchers, health professionals, and innovators.

## **Overview**
We aim to establish the Biomedical Data Science Hub of Sudan to foster an enabling and inclusive community that sustains biomedical data science research and innovation in Sudan.

### **Problem**
There are currently limited initiatives promoting data science in Sudan. There is a considerable need for collaboration, training, and access to data in the biomedical science domain.

### **Solution**
The Biomedical Data Science Hub of Sudan aims to:
1. Foster a collaborative and inclusive community for biomedical data science.
2. Enable open access to biomedical data and resources.
3. Build capacity through training and mentorship for Sudanese researchers.
4. Drive large-scale research projects to address pressing health challenges in Sudan and beyond.
